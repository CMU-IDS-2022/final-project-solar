 **Abstract**
In this final project, we plan to focus on the different US states and understand the changes in renewable energy and nonrenewable energy over time. Our main question to investigate is: **Which state in the US had the largest increase in renewable energy and the largest reduction in the nonrenewable energy over time?** We will be using the 1960-2019 state energy production estimate data published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) to create visualisations and extract trends and insights [1]. Additional data displayed in a map visualisation and the tooltip feature will display the renewable energy goals that each states has adopted. This will be based on Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) data from the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) [2]. The energy data will be represented as a percentage of the total energy profile. By doing so, we can begin to understand how close each state is to reaching their RPS goals, which is typically stated as a percentage to be met by a certain year. This will help us see which states are more proactive to convert fully into clean energy and see whether the states are working towards their set goals at a reasonable rate. Ultimately, this will help us understand how policies are linked to actions, specially how effective policies are in driving renewable energy.

Another question we can focus on is: **How long would it take for renewable energy to replace fossil fuels?** So with our visualisation, we plan to use SKforecast and create a time forecasting model to predict the energy percentages in the future. We can then use existing data to extrapolate trends about the future to see whether the current rate is reasonable to reach the state-defined RPS goals.
